                Since many gases have no odor and typically cannot be detected by human senses, gas analyzers play a crucial role in protecting human health and safety and preventing explosions and other catastrophic events. Detectors are widely used by the mining and petrochemical industries and for landfill management, wastewater treatment , manufacturing, and other applications.
            </p>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Gas analytical instrumentation includes gas analysis monitoring systems that are used to detect and monitor levels of various gases. This includes oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and other gases. Some gas analyzers detect and measure a single gas where multi-gas analyzers are configured for applications involving two or more gases.

            <h4>Ambient Air Monitoring Systems</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Use ambient air monitoring systems for applications requiring monitoring and assessment of gases and pollutants indoors. Our inventory includes permanently mounted and portable systems for monitoring a wide range of common gases.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Continuous Gas Analyzers</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Continuous gas analyzers are mountable cabinet-sized systems that detect the presence of combustible gases, emissions, or vapors. This type of gas analytics instrumentation is ideal for preventing catastrophic events at landfills, sewage treatment facilities, and oil and gas processing operations.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Flame Detection Sensors</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Flame detection use ultraviolet, multi-spectrum infrared, ultraviolet/infrared, and visual imaging to detect the electromagnetic radiation emitted by flames. Installing these gas sensors helps prevent catastrophic fires by detecting flames caused by vapors from gasoline, solvents, and other substances.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Gas Analysis Systems</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Gas analysis systems provide optical analysis of gases and impurities that are present at low concentrations. This equipment includes tunable diode lasers and gas detection devices to monitor hydrocarbon and other toxic or combustible gases commonly present in chemical plants, oil and gas operations, and power generation facilities.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Multi-Gas Systems</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Multi-gas systems provide the convenience of detecting multiple types of gas with a single sensor. Monitor oxygen depletion or the presence of toxic and flammable gases. We offer field mounted and fixed multi-gas sensors to meet your needs.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Toxic Gas Detectors</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Toxic gas detectors monitor the presence and concentration of combustible, flammable, and toxic gases and vapors. Select from intermittent or continuous monitoring systems providing audible or visual alarms when percentages reach dangerous levels.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Gas Analytics Accessories </h4><br>
