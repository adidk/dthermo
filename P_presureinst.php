                Pressure instrumentation includes various pressure gauges, transmitters, sensors, and transducers that are used to measure and display the units of pressure of a fluid or gas. Transducers, transmitters, and sensors measure the pressure in pumps, pipes, tanks, and other processes and then send a signal to a display, controller, HMI, or other device . Pressure gauges are analog or digital devices used to display the readings and provide local real-time measurement for effective pressure monitoring.

            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Regularly measuring the pressure levels of gas, steam, and liquids is critical for safety and quality control in commercial and industrial applications. Some of the industries where pressure measurement is used include chemical plants and oil, gas, petroleum or other petrochemical applications, Water and Wastewater, Food and Beverage, Concrete, heating and cooling, lumber and paper products and more.

            </p><br>
            <h4>Diaphragm Seals</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Protect pressure instrumentation from corrosive or viscous process media and extremely low and high operating temperatures. Diaphragm seals are flexible membranes available in various sizes and configurations to fit pressure gauges, transmitters, and switches. Our inventory of diaphragm seals includes options from WIKA, NOSHOK, Red Valve, and Winters.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Analog & Digital Gauges </h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Pressure gauges are devices that provide local pressure and vacuum readings. We stock analog and digital pressure gauges from WIKA, NOSHOK, Marsh, Winters, Orange Research, Cecomp, Weksler, and Midwest. Select from pressure and differential pressure Gauges in both analog and digital versions.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Pressure Accessories</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Pressure accessories include needle valves, snubbers, overpressure protectors, and steam siphons for pressure gauges and transmitters. Our wide selection of pressure accessories includes options from WIKA, NOSHOK, Chemiquip, Ray, and Winters.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Pressure Transmitters & Transducers</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Pressure transducers are devices that convert pressure readings into voltage or millivolt (mv) signals that are sent to a display, controller, or PLC. Pressure transmitters convert pressure reading into amplified Milliamp (mA) signals that are sent to a display, controller or PLC. We carry pressure transmitters and transducers from manufacturers, including Krohne, WIKA, NOSHOK, Barksdale, Gems, and Turck.
            </p><br>

            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Pressure regulators reduce the supply pressure of gases and liquids to maintain the desired outlet pressure as inlet pressure fluctuates. Use these pressure regulators with compressors or high-pressure tanks. Select from a range of pressure regulators from Tescom, Bellofram, and ASCO.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Pressure Switches </h4><br>
