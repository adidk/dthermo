                Temperature instrumentation includes a wide range of field instruments and sensors used to measure temperature in commercial and industrial systems. These temperature control systems include manual and automatic processes for monitoring and controlling the temperature to maintain an ideal operating range to optimize production and prevent equipment damage or failure.
            </p>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Local temperature instrumentation is typically reserved for non-critical applications or when temperature fluctuations are minimal and occur slowly. Automatic applications utilize sensors and other field instruments that provide a signal or alarm when temperatures reach a specified level. These are used for critical applications where temperatures can quickly change. Depending on the application, they can be more convenient than manual field instruments because they do not require an operator to take the measurements.

            <br>

            <h4>Temperature Controllers</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                These are an integral part of a temperature control system and include basic on/off type controllers as well as sophisticated PID and multiloop controllers. We carry temperature controllers from Watlow, West/Partlow, Red Lion, and Krohne.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Heaters</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Heaters include cartridge, band, immersion, jacketing, wiring and tape used to heat pipes, tanks, and other process equipment. These items are used to maintain temperature setpoints in process control and manufacturing and prevent freezing in cold operating environments. Our inventory includes heaters from Watlow and Briskheat.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Infrared Pyrometers </h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                These hand-held temperature instruments use infrared energy to take temperature readings and display the numerical temperature on a screen. Because they can take readings from a distance, they are commonly used for applications involving moving equipment or hazardous substances. We stock a variety of infrared pyrometers from Fluke.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Temperature Transmitters </h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Transmitters connect to temperature sensors to transmit signals to a PLC or other display system for monitoring and control purposes. Our inventory includes temperature signal conditioners and RTD and thermocouple sensors.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Thermal Imagers</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                These field instruments use infrared energy to provide non-contact temperature monitoring. When measurements are taken, it produces a thermal image on the device screen that allows the user to determine heat levels and profiles. They provide precise readings and can be used on stationary or moving equipment. We offer several thermal imager models from Fluke.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Temperature Switches </h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Mechanical and electronic temperature switches are used in fluid and gas control applications to open or close switch contacts once a preset temperature is reached. Options include temperature switches from Barksdale, ASCO, and Solon.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Dial Thermometers </h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Dial thermometers provide a simple, yet accurate way to measure and indicate temperature using expansion, bimetal, or gas-actuated principles. This style of thermometer offers the option of being read either remotely using capillary tubing, or at the point of measurement. We have stock bi-metal dial thermometers.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Thermowells </h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Thermowells protect temperature sensors and instrumentation from high pressure and corrosive or abrasive substances. They also eliminate the need to drain process fluids before removing or replacing a thermometer.
            </p>
