                Automation is the driving force behind modern manufacturing and testing. Processing and manufacturing times are drastically cut, reducing overhead and increasing ROI. Innovative technology gives workers the power to oversee an entire factory’s worth of operations from a single screen to monitor production and quickly identify issues. Light curtains, machine protection systems, and other devices minimize workplace hazards to keep workers safe. These Tools help businesses increase productivity to accommodate the needs of high volume and high-speed manufacturing processes so they can stay competitive in today’s market.

            <h4>Controllers & Data Acquisition</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Data acquisition stations and controllers gather and digitize measurement signals for control and/or storage and analysis. This process collects data for monitoring and analyzing testing and manufacturing processes. The visualization of data enables easier analysis and allows you to monitor multiple stations across multiple areas of a facility. Meet all your process control needs with products from Red Lion, Watlow, and Partlow.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Encoders</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Rotary, incremental, and absolute encoders monitor the position of a shaft and convert the data into an analog or digital signal to measure changes in position, speed, or linear distance. Options include optical encoders for high resolution and operating speed and magnetic encoders for dusty and dirty working environments. Our inventory of encoders includes products from Dynapar, Turck, and Red Lion.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Human Machine Interface (HMI) Displays</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Industrial HMI touch panels provide a textual or graphical interface between industrial automation systems and users. They can display data, graphics, and animation to provide control and monitoring of automation systems. We carry rugged HMI displays from Red Lion for use in a variety of operating environments.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Industrial Computing</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Controls and automation instrumentation require software, HMIs, ethernet switches, data stations, and other equipment to provide communication between different devices and users. We stock a variety of industrial computing products from Red Lion,Turck, and Watlow.

                Photoelectric sensors, also called photo eyes, use infrared light transmitters to detect the presence and proximity of an object without making physical contact. Inductive proximity sensors perform that same function but use an inductive switch to sense an object and are specifically designed for the detection of metal objects. Typical applications for both types of instruments include manufacturing, packaging,, positioning, and counting .
