                Level instrumentation includes a range of level measurement equipment including switches, controllers, transducers and radars. These instruments play a vital role in ensuring silos, tanks and vessels maintain levels that are within safe operating limits. This not only protects equipment but helps prevent environmental and safety hazards.
            </p>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                There are two level instrument types: point level and continuous level. Point level instrumentation is used to detect variations in dry and liquid levels in silos, tanks and vessels and often incorporate the use of sensors alarms to indicate a low or high condition. Continuous level instrumentation is used for similar purposes except it provides continuous measurement of levels within a silo, tank or vessel.

            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Continuous level and point level instrumentation can be used for applications involving gases, liquids, powders, bulk solids and slurry and are used by several industries, including:

            <h4>Continuous Level and Point Level Instrumentation for Bulk Solid, Gas and Fluid Level Monitoring</h4><br>
            <p class="text-size-19 text-justify">
                Our options for continuous level instrumentation and point level instrumentation include:
            </p><br>
            <ul>
                <li class="text-size-19 text-justify"><b>Capacitance Probe Switches</b> Point level switches that detect high and low levels of solids and liquids in tanks, bins and silos. The switches feature two electrodes and use the fluid within the container as a dielectric. Fluid levels are determined by measuring changes in the capacitance value.</li>
                <li class="text-size-19 text-justify"><b>Mechanical Floats</b>: This includes point level measurement solutions such as spheres, balls and oblong objects that are buoyant in liquid and serve as visual indicators for level measurement applications. They can be solid or hollow and are made from either plastic or corrosion-resistance stainless steel.</li>
                <li class="text-size-19 text-justify"><b>Rotating Paddle Switches</b>: These are point level switches used to detect levels of powders and bulk materials in silos and other vessels. The switches are powered by an electric motor and continuously rotate until they make contact with a material, which then creates force that causes the rotation to stop.</li>
                <li class="text-size-19 text-justify"><b>Ultrasonic</b>: This type of level measurement transmitter uses high-frequency sound to detect product levels. The transmitter is placed at the top of a tank and transmits ultrasonic pulses that are reflected off the surface of the product. The sensor then creates a measurement calculation based off the signal. Ultrasonic transmitters are used for continuous level measurement.</li>
                <li class="text-size-19 text-justify"><b>Vibrating Tuning Fork Switches</b>: These point level measurement switches are installed in pipes and vessels to detect high and low fluid level and prevent overflow. The switches contain two prongs that vibrate at a natural frequency until they become immersed in the product, which causes the frequency to drop. These changes are monitored by sensors that can be programmed to trigger an alarm or valve once a certain level is reached. </li>
                <li class="text-size-19 text-justify"><b>Hydrostatic (Pressure) Transmitters</b>: A type of continuous level measurement transmitter used for water and other liquid applications. This level instrumentation device determines fluid levels by measuring the force or pressure within a resting body of fluid.</li>
                <li class="text-size-19 text-justify"><b>Guided Wave Radar</b>: These continuous level controllers use radar to measure levels of fluids and dry media. The radar level control equipment features a probe that is immersed in the liquid or dry media and sends low energy pulses down the probe. The energy then reflects up the probe and provides the measurement between the surface of the media and the top of the storage vessel.</li>
                <li class="text-size-19 text-justify"><b>Non-Contacting Radar</b>: This type of radar level instrumentation detects surfaces that reflect energy and measures dry or fluid levels by determining the amount of time it takes for a transmitted signal to reflect on the surface and return to the transmitter. It provides continuous level calculations for both volume and mass.</li>
